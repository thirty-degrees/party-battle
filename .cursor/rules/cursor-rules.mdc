## Gluestack UI Components

Always use gluestack-ui style components when available. If components need to be installed, get them via the v2 way using:

```
npx gluestack-ui add <component>
```

Ask before adding custom-made style components. Prioritize existing gluestack-ui components over custom styling.

## Code Style

Never write comments in code. Write self-documenting code instead.
